# UFOs
# Overview
The purpose of this project was to create a site for Dana to showcase her analysis of UFO findings, focused on user's ability and the site's visual appearance. We want to allow users to filter on the large dataset based on a variety of categories, including date, city, state, country, and shape.  This gives the user an easier access to in-depth data rather than be overwhelmed by having to look at and interpret a very large dataset.

# Results
This project resulted in creating a great website that allows Dana room to report her own analysis and findings, while also allowing the users to dig into the data if they choose. The users can search based on date, city, state, country, and shape. Not only is the site useful, it is also pleasing to the eye, using a dark theme with font that is clear and sticks out. We also used a cool photo from NASA that matches with the theme of her analysis. 
### How to Perform Search
To search our site, navigate down to the search section. The user will see a variety of search options. ![search options](https://github.com/juliemags/UFOs/blob/main/Resources/search_options.PNG)

Type in your desired filter(s). In this case, we are searching for California (ca). After pressing "Filter Table", the data table on the right adjusts to your indicated filters and should only show the indicated filter(s).

# Summary
### Advantages
As a new coder, it was relatively easy to construct an HTML code for thsi site. Ease of use is a huge advantage to this process. The website looks clean and concise, while also including a lot of very vital information. 

### Drawbacks
When searching for a condition, you have to match the letters perfectly. I tried to search "CA" for California, and nothing popped up. However, when I searched "ca", there was a large amount of spottings. A new user to the site may be confused or tricked by this issue. Adding a note to only search in lowercase or allowing the code to read any variety of lettercase would fix this. 


### Recommendations
- One recommendation would be to have text pop up "No Results Found" if the criteria did not match any data. I tried to look for the state "il" but there were no results. However, since nothing popped up, I wasn't sure if the data wasn't loading properly, or if there were truly no results found. 
- I also think that the suggested text in the search options is too dark. It is difficult to distinguish what is manually typed and what is auto suggested as an example. Perhaps making that text lighter or have it say "example: circle" for each line would be easier to read.
